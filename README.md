# Python challenges

## Decsription

Quick coding challenges using Python.

## Project folders

Every project folder contains a challenge with a documented function(s) and a test file with test cases.

All dependencies can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Documentation

Documentation for the entire project can be easily created by running `pdoc --html --output-dir <project-folder>/docs <project-folder>/`â€” the `pdoc` package is included in the list of dependencies.

## Testing

To test, run `pytest <filename>` replacing the file name with an actual test file name (it is prepended by `test_`).

`pytest` is included in the list of dependencies.
